      <p>
        Math and music are my thing. I have recently become a Ph.D. candidate in computational maths.

        I enjoy sports, specifically athletics and swimming. I do 
        all my coding &ndash; mostly C(++), MATLAB and Python &ndash; in vim.  I write
        my documents using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>.

      <!--<h3>Approximating functions using polynomials</h3>
      <p>
        In my Bachelor's Thesis, my advisor and I looked at a fast algorithm that 
        finds near-optimal approximations to arbitrary functions.  It 
        works by continually refining the approximation "where necessary", making
        it an <em>adaptive</em> algorithm.

      <h3><b>Master's Thesis</b>: hp-adaptive finite elements in 2D</h3>
      <aside class="image">

      </aside>

      <p>
        As the conclusion of my Master's in Mathematics at the University of Amsterdam,
        I wrote a thesis on the Finite Element Method, which is a way of solving
        differential equations numerically. Differential equations describe many
        things in nature, from the aerodynamics of a car to the shape of a soap
        bubble.
      </p>

      <p>
      Together with this thesis, a library written in modern C++ was <a href="https://github.com/Jannertje/hp-afem" target="_blank">published on github</a>.

      </aside>

      <p>
        As the conclusion of a course on parallel algorithms, I collaborated with
        a good friend to analyse, implement and apply the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method" 
          target="_blank">Conjugate Gradient method</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We used C with the <a href="http://openmp.org/wp/" target="_blank">OpenMP</a> and 
        <a href="http://www.mpi-forum.org/" target="_blank">MPI</a> libraries to parallelize 
        our algorithm, and rediscovered a solution to problems generally found in 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method" 
          target="_blank">Finite Element analysis</a>. Read our final report

      <h3>Induced Dimension Reduction: derivation and evaluation</h3>
      <p>
        For a graduate course on Numerical Linear Algebra, we analysed an algorithm
        capable of solving linear systems.  For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_matrix" 
          target="_blank">symmetric linear systems</a>, the holy grail is the 
        above-mentioned Conjugate Gradient method.  For general systems, one can
        prove no equivalent exists.
      </p>

      <p>
      In 1980, the <a href="http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BFb0086930.pdf"
        target="_blank">Induced Dimension Reduction algorithm</a> for solving such general 
        systems was derived.  It was largely replaced by
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconjugate_gradient_method" target="_blank">other</a>, more promising <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconjugate_gradient_stabilized_method" target="_blank">methods</a>, until revisited and generalized in 2008.
        In our report, we show that the novel <a href="http://ta.twi.tudelft.nl/nw/users/gijzen/IDR.html" 
          target="_blank">IDR(<em>s</em>) method</a> outperforms
        the state-of-the-art in many cases.  We used MATLAB to implement the 
        method and performed extensive numerical testing. Read more

      <h3>Keyboard brain transplant</h3>

      <p>
        I felt the desire to tweak my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Hacking_Keyboard" 
          target="_blank">Happy Hacking Keyboard</a>, 
        which has been my daily driver for the past few years.  More specifically,
        I wanted to be able to remap the keys in the most versatile way possible;
        <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=12047.0" target="_blank">this thread</a> 
        guided me to <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/lk7IU/new" target="_blank">this soldering session</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The result is a hardware programmable zombie keyboard
        with blank keycaps, which is therefore able to use not only QWERTY but
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard" target="_blank">any</a>

      <h3>Hacking the Wiki game</h3>
      <aside class="image">
        <a href="http://rexvalkering.nl/wiki/index.php/Hacking_the_Wiki_Game" target="_blank"> <img src="images/wiki.png" /> </a>
      </aside>

      <p>
        In a course on complex system simulations, we analysed <a 
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game" target="_blank">the Wiki game</a>.
        This is a text-based game designed to work specifically with Wikipedia,
        where the goal is to reach a specific article in the smallest number of
        clicks, starting from the Random page.
      </p>

      <p>
        We looked at ways to increase this number averaged over all starting 
        pages by removing pages or links between pages, and simulated attacks 
        on the Wikipedia network using these strategies.  We put our findings 
        in practice by actually editing Wikipedia pages:  The result is a 20% 
        less visible Justin Bieber, as opposed to Britney Spears, who is now 
        20% easier to find.  Find the wiki page on this project

      <h3>Wavelets and the JPEG-2000 algorithm (in Dutch)</h3>
      <aside class="image">
        <a href="files/wavelets.pdf" target="_blank"> <img src="images/wavelets.png" /> </a>
      </aside>

      <p>
        As our second year project, a friend and I studied the JPEG-2000 algorithm
        from a mathematical point of view. JPEG-2000 is a wavelet-based compression
        algorithm which often exhibits better performance than the original (DCT-based)
        JPEG algorithm at similar compression rates. Read more <a href="files/wavelets.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> (in Dutch).
